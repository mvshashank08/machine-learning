# Machine Learning
This repository contains code using various machine learning algorithms from `scikit-learn` across the domains of supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The code is primarily inspired from the book "[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291)".

It cover the following topics:
* Introduction to Python
* Numpy, Matplotlib
* Classification (binay, multi-class)
* Regression
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Ensembles
    * Voting Classifier
    * Bagging Classifier
    * Gradient Boosting
    * Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost )
* Clustering
    * Mean Shift Clustering
    * Spectral Clustering
    * k-means Clustering
* Dimensionality Reduction
    * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    * Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
    * Incremental PCA
